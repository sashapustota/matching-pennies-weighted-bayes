# Matching Pennies: Weighted Bayesian Strategy

This repository contains an implementation of a Weighted Bayesian strategy for the classic two-player game, Matching Pennies. Matching Pennies is a simple game where two players simultaneously reveal either heads or tails, and the outcome is determined by whether the choices match.

As seen in the plot below, the weighted bayesian strategy successfully infers and exploits the bias of the agent, without having to rely on perfect memory.
